Some further directions:

- The current display is a slideshow with a single image at a time.  Show multiple images at the same time.  Needed for video wall installation.

- Remove the UI.  Show only a maximized image.  Show the search query derived from speech input as a subtitle superimposed on the image.  Hide the list of queries.

- search YouTube for videos

- game: try to make a picture of X appear without saying "X".  IF X is an actor, you would try her friends or the movies she appeared in.

- incorporate TalkShow into the [Translating Telephone](https://dprhcp108.doteasy.com/~johndimm/TranslatingTelephone/)
