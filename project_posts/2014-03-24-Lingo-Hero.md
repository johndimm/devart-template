I was inspired at the conference to start a new app, named after the music game. Guitar Hero gives you the impression that you are playing guitar even though you have never studied it.  Lingo Hero gives you the impression that you are speaking a foreign language even though you have never studied it.  It uses speech synthesis to read sentences to you.  Your goal is to say each word just well enough for speech recognition in that language to think you said it.  It turns out speech recognition is very forgiving, especially if it hears sequences of words, which lets the language model correct errors in your speech.  I'm using short sentences from the multilingual tatoeba corpus of colloquial speech.  Hear and speak the whole sentence or each word independently.  You get a great sense of accomplishment when you fool it into thinking you just spoke Russian or Arabic, when all you are really doing is imitating what you just heard.  It's not quite ready for independent demos yet.  Let me know if you would like to see it.
